# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console
The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.
You won’t implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

## Project description
The purpose of this project is to create a command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging).
This project will cover the following:
* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object
